```

## Exercise 2: Distributive Law 

```{r}
txhousing_distributive <- txhousing %>% 
  filter( (sales>=3000 | ( listings>4000 & median>=150000 )))

(txhousing_distributive)

## Exercise 3: Percentile Values
```{r}

## Exercise 4: Extreme housing prices 2012 - 2014
```{r}

```
Exercise 5: How many houses are sold at what average price?
```{r}
txhousing_augmented <- 
  mutate(
    txhousing,
    percent_sold = (sales) / (listings)*100,
    average_price = (volume) / (sales))

glimpse(txhousing_augmented)
```

## Exercise 6: Total and Average Sales Price by Year
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sales_by_year = txhousing %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sale_price = mean(volume, na.rm=TRUE),
            total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm=TRUE))

sales_by_year
```

## Exercise 7: Number and Value of sales in 2014
```{r}
basic_housing = txhousing %>% 
  mutate(txhousing, average_price = volume/sales) %>%
  filter(year == 2014, city == "Dallas") %>% 
  select(city, year, month, sales, volume, average_price) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_price))

```

## Exercise 9: Merging previous table with Population 
```{r}

  city = c("Houston" , "San Antonio" , "Austin" , "Dallas"), 
  population = c(2100263 , 1327407 , 1197816 , 790390)
